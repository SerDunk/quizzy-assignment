# Quiz App with Gamification

## Project Overview

This is an interactive quiz application that incorporates gamification elements to enhance user engagement. The app includes a 50/50 option that eliminates two incorrect answers but provides fewer points when used. Additionally, users can track their previous scores to improve their performance over time.

## Features

- **Engaging Quiz Experience:** Answer multiple-choice questions and earn points.
- **50/50 Lifeline:** Remove two incorrect answers but earn reduced points for that question.
- **Score Tracking:** View previous scores to analyze and improve performance.
- **Responsive UI:** Seamless experience across different devices.
